# NT PorchFest 2024

## Yearly Update

This is a personal community project for me, I built and continue to update, manage and host this website at a discounted rate for a local musical event my friends hold.

- Generally rebuilt on a yearly basis
- Allows people in the community and bands to registar and sumbit their waivers if they wish to participate.
- Provides information on the event.

At some point they are looking in to getting a shop up as well, as excited as I have been to get it going they have so far opted out.

## 2024 Update

In this update I transitioned from a slightly dated but completely personal version to a using bootstrap and incorparating galleries to usher in a much smoother 1 page experience with clear buttons for all the most important information right at the top.

- Bootstrap
- Displays multiple galleries from years past
- Hero section shows off different artwork and logos, working on getting some logos of the bands and stuff that will be playing and some other stuff.
- I did not create the NT Porch Fest logo but all other logos and artwork on the page are my doing with either Adobe or AI. 
- Utilizes Gsuite to take entries on google forms and completely automate the registrantion process by storing all the information and signed waivers in a folder until we are ready for them. 

A large part of this project is about keeping costs as low as possible while still keeping it functional and visually pleasing. I believe I have met that goal year after year.
